# Supervised_Machine_Learning

I have tried to predict the percentage given the number of hours studied.

Linear_Regression.ipynb is the python code for building an appropriate ML model. It is created using Jupyter notebook.

Supervised_ML_Deployment folder contains all the details on deployment of our model using Flask API.

Linear_Regression_Flask_Deployment.mp4 contains the screen recording of our final application.
